## Abstract

This project explores the integration of Generative AI (GenAI) in automating human resource (HR) management tasks. It proposes a generalized AI model trained on organization-specific data‚Äîsuch as policies, workflows, and templates‚Äîto assist in document generation, automated emails, reminders, and employee guidance. The objective is to enhance HR operational efficiency, minimize errors, and reduce manual workloads while ensuring adherence to internal corporate standards.

## Related works

Existing literature highlights the growing role of AI in HR tasks such as recruitment, performance management, and training. The AI Capability Framework (ACF) is widely used to assess readiness for AI integration. Research on Generative AI, such as ChatGPT and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), emphasizes their utility in decision support. However, most studies focus on analytical rather than operational automation. This project addresses that gap by using GenAI for execution-oriented tasks within HRM, like document handling and query-based guidance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project followed a structured five-phase methodology:

1. **Understanding AI Concepts**  
   - Literature reviews, workshops, self-study (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)

2. **Studying HR Functions**  
   - Interviews, surveys, observational studies in multiple industries.

3. **Architectural Design**  
   - Identified common HR functions across sectors.
   - Designed a modular, adaptable solution architecture.

4. **Model Development**  
   - Built and trained a GenAI model with NLP, RLHF, and feedback loops.

5. **Deployment & Evaluation**  
   - Tested in pilot organizations with performance benchmarking.
